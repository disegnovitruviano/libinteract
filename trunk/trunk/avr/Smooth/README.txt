Smooth.h Smooth.c
Part of LibInteract for AVR
Alexandre Quessy 2008

Just a small (working) draft of a smoothing class. 
Implements the "slide" equation.

This is a C classes. It uses a struct for storing the attributes. 
All function calls need a pointer to a variable of type Smooth_t as a
first argument. Look for tutorials on pointers.
